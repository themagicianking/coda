        Coda is an app I created for my final project with Techtonica. I grew up
        with vinyl, CDs, and cassettes as my primary music sources, and I wanted
        to bring some of that analog nostalgia into the digital world. I love
        creating playlists for my friends and am often frustrated that I can't
        stick a paper note to a Spotify playlist, the way I used to with a CD
        insert or a casette tape. Coda is my solution: a way to add your
        personal notes to a digitally created playlist.
